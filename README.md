  location TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'Safestore',
  "personName" TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc'::text, NOW()),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT TIMEZONE('utc'::text, NOW())
);

-- Add constraints
ALTER TABLE inventory_items
ADD CONSTRAINT valid_location CHECK (location IN ('Safestore', 'Home')),
